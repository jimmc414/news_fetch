We would like to find out more about families in the US who are gathering together for the upcoming holidays, or who spent time together over Thanksgiving, and have different political views from one another. Do you have concerns about people having differing views and arguing about them? Are you worried about clashes that might happen when the family come together? Or have you banned any talk of politics over the holidays?
