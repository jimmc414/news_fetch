----------------------------------------
A new take on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is reportedly in early development. According to Deadline, Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson’s Eon Productions – best known for the James Bond movies – will team with Amazon-MGM for a re-imagining of the classic children’s story aiming for a theatrical release. Reportedly, meetings with writers and directors are currently being set. The original book was written by the 007 author Ian Fleming and published in 1964 before being adapted into a hit movie in 1968, co-scripted by Roald Dahl and starring Dick Van Dyke. It was also produced by Albert R Broccoli, who co-founded Eon. While the film was well-received and the 10th biggest film at the box office that year, it lost money as the budget was so high at the time. It also received an Oscar nomination for best original song. It was later turned into a musical, opening on the West End in 2002 and later Broadway in 2005. Back in 2008, it was reported by the Telegraph that a big-screen remake was being considered by Wilson. Eon Productions is next set to work on a new James Bond movie with an actor still to be attached. Last month, it was reported that the next choice will be in his 30s and may not be white. “Every time we cast a new actor, the films change,” Wilson said. “It’s the excitement of a new Bond, a new direction. Every one of these people who took on the role offered something new and different.” The last Bond movie, 2021’s No Time to Die, made $774m worldwide.
