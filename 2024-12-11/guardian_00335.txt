----------------------------------------
Donald Trump has named Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host who has been engaged to Trump’s eldest son, to be the US ambassador to Greece. “For many years, Kimberly has been a close friend and ally,” Trump wrote in a statement. “Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation.” Guilfoyle’s nomination would require Senate confirmation. She wrote on social media: “I’m honored to accept President Trump’s nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece and I look forward to earning the support of the US Senate.” The president-elect has been filling out his administration with loyalists, donors and family members. Trump chose Charles Kushner, his son-in-law’s father, to serve as ambassador to France, and Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of daughter Tiffany Trump, to serve as a Middle East adviser. Guilfoyle – who was engaged to Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr in 2020 – has served as a campaign fundraiser and surrogate for Trump. She has not served in any foreign policy or diplomacy role, working as a prosecutor in California before transitioning to a career in television. Guilfoyle left Fox News in 2017. In 2020, the New Yorker detailed allegations from a former assistant of Guilfoyle who had accused her of repeated sexual harassment.
