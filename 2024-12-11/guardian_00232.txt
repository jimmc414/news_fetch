----------------------------------------
Last week’s shocking shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a street in New York, though widely condemned, also sparked an outpouring of online vitriol towards the US’s profit-driven healthcare industry. Luigi Mangione, 26, has now been charged with Thompson’s murder. Bullet cases left at the scene of the killing displayed the words “delay” and “deny”, suggesting the killing may be linked to the largely privatized US healthcare industry’s routine denial of payments to many Americans. Though the killing of the father of two has been widely condemned, it has sparked a national debate over many Americans’ experience with the healthcare industry, with social media feeds flooded with stories of being denied care or being handed huge bills. We’d like to hear from people about their own US healthcare experiences. Were you happy with your coverage? Or did you feel you were treated badly? Do you think other countries with greater involvement of government do things better?
