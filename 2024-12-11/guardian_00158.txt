----------------------------------------
I remember the day the Guardian bought the Observer in 1993. I was so thrilled when I heard the news that I immediately rang my mother so we could share our excitement about the Observer joining the family. The news that Guardian Media Group now wants to flog off the Observer has joined the list of moments when I think: “Well, it’s a good thing my mother didn’t live to see this.” My father died before the two papers were united, but I don’t think he’d be very happy about the latest development either. His name was Patrick Monkhouse, and he was deputy editor of the Guardian. Harriet Monkhouse Manchester • The Guardian and Observer journalists who responded, in a letter (Key questions about the sale of the Observer that remain unanswered, 9 December), to an article by the chair of the Scott Trust about the proposed sale of the Observer to Tortoise Media included a Scott Trust director. If even one of your own thinks it’s time to press pause, surely a rethink really is in order? Alison Chapman Aberdour, Fife • We are often told how much our support is appreciated. It would be nice if someone rewarded our support by asking our opinion on the plan to sell off the Observer. Terry Walton London
