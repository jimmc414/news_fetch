• An article (‘Humans are nourished by contact with others’, 10 December, G2, p4) transposed the professions of Charlotte Korsager Winther, a personal trainer, and Hanne Garder, a human resources worker whose name we misspelled as “Garper”. A quote by Winther (“You’ve got water on three sides …”) was also incorrectly attributed to Garder. • The Willow computing chip measures 4cm squared, not “4 sq cm” (Scientists’ minds boggled by Google’s new chip, 10 December, p12). This error was in print only. • Other recently amended articles include: Jamal Khashoggi’s widow urges Starmer to raise husband’s murder at Saudi meeting Labour’s ‘planning laws reform’ is really an attack on local democracy World’s oldest-known wild bird lays egg on Midway Atoll at age 74 The best Christmas trees: everything you need to know, from sustainability to style The Guardian view on Horrible Histories: laughing to learn TV tonight: the most underwatched series in years returns one last time ‘War zone stuff’: researchers highlight unequal impact of natural disasters on women Tory pair backed ‘rushed and misjudged’ asylum site purchase, watchdog says Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
