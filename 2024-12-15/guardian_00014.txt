• We mistakenly referred to the burial ship discovered at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, as a Viking vessel, when it is from the earlier Anglo‑Saxon period (Water, walks and cafés: this is Britain’s happiest town, 5 December, p11). In the same article, rankings that put London in 40th place, Edinburgh at 50th, Belfast at 66th and so on, were from a survey by Mercer of global cities with the highest quality of living, not from Rightmove’s poll of the UK’s happiest places to live. • Other recently amended articles include: Kevin Andrews: politicians across the spectrum pay tribute to former Liberal defence minister after death at 69 Survivor of Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor dies in California aged 100 Elon Musk’s six major conflicts of interest with the federal government No further action after man held over Alison Hammond blackmail claims Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: guardian.readers@theguardian.com.
