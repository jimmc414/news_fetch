Reading your article about the Santa Claus debacle (‘Kids were in tears’: visitors complain of Santa ‘shambles’ at Hampshire grotto, 10 December), one summer my husband (big white beard) and I were sipping a glass of wine in a Spanish cafe. A little girl at the next table asked her father why Santa Claus was there. I was able to say in Spanish that, yes, it is Santa Claus and he is on holiday in Spain, but she mustn’t breathe a word about it. “Santa” sent over a sparkling new euro coin as a reward. Her eyes were like saucers.
