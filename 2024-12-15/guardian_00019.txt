A man has died after falling from a balcony at the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, police said. The incident occurred at the city centre site at about 9pm on Friday, just as the complex was about to close. The centre was closed after emergency services were dispatched to the scene after reports by witnesses of a man falling from an upper level. The man, whose name and age have not been disclosed, was pronounced dead at the scene. West Midlands police said the death was not being treated as suspicious and the case was being passed on to the city coroner. A spokesperson for the police said: “We were called at 9.04pm on Friday after a man fell from the upper level of the Bullring. The man sadly died at the scene. His next-of-kin have been informed and his death is not being treated as suspicious.” The incident came just days after shoppers in Birmingham were told to stay away from one of the shopping centre’s car parks after a car became engulfed in flames. The incident happened to an Alfa Romeo Spider inside the Selfridges Moor Street car park just before 10.30am. It was caused by a faulty engine from a petrol-powered car, West Midlands fire service said. At least one nearby car also caught fire as a result.
