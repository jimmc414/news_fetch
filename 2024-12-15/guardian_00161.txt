A two-year-old boy has died and two adults have been left in a critical condition after a hit-and-run involving a stolen Porsche in the West Midlands. Police said four adults and a child were taken to hospital after a collision in Smethwick shortly before 11pm on Saturday night. A two-year-old boy died, while a woman, 29, and a man, 30, remained in a serious condition. The conditions of another man and woman, both 30, were described as stable. West Midlands police appealed for the driver of a grey Porsche Cayenne – who they said fled the scene after their car collided with a Toyota carrying the victims – to “do the right thing and hand themselves in”. DS Paul Hughes, from the serious collision investigation unit, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of the little boy at this extremely difficult time. “I would urge the driver of the Porsche to do the right thing and come and talk to us. They made the wrong decision to run away and I’m asking them now to make the right one. “I also want to appeal to anyone who witnessed the collision and hasn’t already spoken to us, or has CCTV or dashcam footage, to get in touch.” Police said it was believed the driver of the Porsche was travelling from a roundabout on Kenrick Way before it collided with the Toyota on Dartmouth Road. The road was closed in both directions while specialist officers examined the scene, but has since reopened. Checks on the car revealed that it was stolen earlier this month, the force added. To contact the serious collision investigation unit, email SCIU@westmidlands.police.uk, call 101, or live chat via WMP online between 8am and midnight, quoting log 4421 14 December.
